Checking room conflicts for remaining classes...

Timewindow improvements applied successfully.

Attempting to solve model...

Solver status: 3
Problem is proven infeasible - no solution exists
Possible reasons for infeasibility:
1. Contradictory constraints for fixed classes
2. Insufficient time windows for sequential scheduling
3. Conflicting resources without alternatives

Analyzing conflicts in the model...
Found 0 conflicting constraints:

No solution found within the time limit (0.49 seconds).
Try increasing the time limit or relaxing some constraints.
